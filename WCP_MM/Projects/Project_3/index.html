He was considered a child-prodigy as he was able to solve calculus problems at the age of 8. He never lived a normal life as his family was really rich and was taught with tutors. He was the man that also worked on the Manhattan Project and developed the first computer that stored memory. His contribution to the Mathematics and Science department has led to new theories and breakthrough to our society.</span>

Some examples to those times are the Cuban Missile Crisis during the Cold War, the Norwegian Rocket and more. This podcast was more on speculations as no one really know what happened at the time. The hosts talked about what would of happened if one of those crisis did lead to a war, which they depict a bloodbath. This podcast should interest those that are more into history and its a great reminder to avoid this event to ever happen.</span>

In this podcast, it talks about kids from WWII, Vietnam War and many more. Some of the stories of the children relates to the killing of their parents or their town/village destroyed. This would lead to organizations being made to help fund new homes to the kids and to support them throughout their lives. Some were left with foster parents while others were reunited with their parents after the war.</span>
