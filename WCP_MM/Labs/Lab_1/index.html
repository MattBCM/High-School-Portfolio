Hi guys, my name is Matthew Murillo and I am a Web Design senior at Information Technology High School. Right now, the field of study that I am interested on is Computer Science. The reason why I want to focus on Computer Science is because I have an interest in creating stuff on the internet and I would like to have that as a job or hobby in the future. Also I want to study on Computer Science, because in the near future, basically there will be technology everywhere that will need programmers to program them. Having a job in programming would be very demanding, so its a good idea to study on Computer Science.

<br><br>

I do many things in my free time like play games with my friends, read some articles and also enjoy some time with my family. I basically would like to do tasks that allows me to interact with the people I know. My dreams for the future is to create games that appeals to people and for them to have fun with it. It would be cool to work in a game developer studio, but i would like to make some side projects of my own. Basically my goals is to get into college, get a Masters Degree in Computer Science and to make my parents proud of who I am
