<th width="25%"><div align="left"><p style="font-size: 25px">Shrek is about an ogre who lives in a swamp that was turning to a refuge for fairy-tale creatures by the order of Lord Farquaad. As a compromise to fix his swamp, Shrek agrees to go on a quest to rescue Princess Fiona, a trapped maiden that Lord Farquaad wants to marry. With his companion Donkey, they travel through distant land to rescue Fiona from the Dragon. As Shrek and the gang returns to Farquaad's castle, Shrek and Fiona grow intimate feeling for each other. Fiona however is scared to telling her friends about her "ogre-transformation" secret. In the end, Fiona realizes that Shrek was her true love and they live happily ever after.<br><br>One reason why this is my favorite movie, is because I've always been watching this movie when I was little. Also, there have been many memes about this movie that makes me love it more. Another reason why I like the movie, is because of the jokes. Some of the jokes I got it when I first watched it, but the more time I watched the movie, the more jokes I understand in the movie. Shrek is just filled with jokes that makes me laugh. The color scheme of this page is a light green-green scheme. The reason why I chose this scheme, is because Shrek is a green ogre and that what makes him unique.</p></div>
