<th width="25%"><div align="left"><p style="font-size: 22px">Emoji Movie is about an emoji named Gene who is very different from the other emojis. Each emoji has their own expression, but Gene doesn't. Gene decides to go embark on a quest with his friend Hi-5 to make himself "normal". Along the way, he met a hacker named Jailbreak and she knows how to reprogram Gene to be a normal "Meh" emoji. Along the journey, the phone that their world is in was about to be wiped out completely, so they had to rush to Dropbox quickly. At the climax of the Movie, Gene has feelings for Jailbreak, but she doesn't. This made Gene depressed and become a "Meh" emoji. Jailbreak realizes the consequence of her action and went back to the phone to tell Gene about himself. At the end, Jailbreak tells Gene to be himself and he becomes a multi-facial emoji, which stopped the boy from wiping his phone. All the emojis cheered for joy and Gene had the job he always dreamed of.<br><br>This is one of my favorite movies, because There were many life lessons that I learned in this movie. One lesson is to be who you want to be. This movie showed me that I have to find out who I really am, and itâ€™s cool how this kid movie implements real life lessons. Another reason why i chose this movie is because it includes so many references to technology. For example, the place that Gene and his friends were trying to go to is Dropbox. Also, one of the puzzles they were trying to solve is a dance off in Just Dance. This made me surprised on how many references there are. I chose the background scheme as red and pink, because of how much love I love the movie. I would recommend the movie to be watched with families or for younger audience.</p></div>
