<th width="25%"><div align="left"><p style="font-size: 22px">Bee Movie is about a bee named Barry Bee Benson, who just got out of college, seeking a job at the Hive Industry. Barry Bee Benson flew outside the hive with a group of “Pollen Jocks”, bees that collect pollen, but got lost due to the rain. Barry befriends a human woman named Vanessa and they spend time together. Barry soon learns from Vanessa that humans were using the bees honey without their permission, so Barry sues the humans. Eventually Barry won the case and all humans must deliver all their honey back to the bees. Since the bees got their honey back, the hive stopped producing honey, and all of the flowers started to decay. Barry realizes the mistake he made and solves the problem by driving an airplane, which is full of flowers, to an airport. The “Pollen Jocks” got the pollen and spread it to all the flowers, which grew back alive”. At the end, Barry becomes a member of the “Pollen Jocks” and he had the job he wanted.<br><br>One reason why this is my favorite movie is because it was my childhood movie. I remember always watching this movie a lot, because I own the DVD of Bee Movie. So, every once in a while, if I feel like watching Bee Movie, then I’ll play it. Another reason why this is my favorite movie is because of the funny and corny jokes that are included. As I watch this movie, I realize how bad and good the jokes were executed in the movie. Finally, I love this movie because it is a popular meme in the internet. It’s funny how a movie that wasn’t popular at the time it was released in November 2nd, 2007 is now suddenly popular. The color scheme I chose for this movie is yellow and gray, because it’s supposed to represent a bee’s stripes.</p></div>
