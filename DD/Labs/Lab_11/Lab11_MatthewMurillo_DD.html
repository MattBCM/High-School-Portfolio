<p>Today I was able to talk to many colleges around New York. There were many varieties to choose from. For example, there are some that is more of engineering and others that are for computer science. For me, I would go for computer science, because I'm more familiar to it. One college that I was able to talk to is New York Institute of Technology. They provided many things that are related to technology. I was able to get some notes that were related to the college. I also received some pamphlets that had information on the college. I would like to thoroughly read them so I can make the best choice for me.<br><br>
Another college that I wanted to check out is Hunter college. My mom told me that it was a good college, because she went there, so I was interested. As I listen to the spokesperson, there was actually a requirement to get a scholarship from Hunter college. One requirement is having a 1300 in the SAT and passing AP courses with high grades. I would like to get the scholarship so I'll need to work hard for it. Also I was able to see colleges from upstate NY like Oswego State University. I would like to come back here next year to talk to more colleges so that I make the right choice. This is what I experience in this year's College and Career Fair.</p>
